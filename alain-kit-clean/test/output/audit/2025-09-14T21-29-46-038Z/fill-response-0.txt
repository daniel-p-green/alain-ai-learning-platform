>We need to produce JSON array of StepFillJSON objects for section 1-1 of "Getting Started with GPT-Oss-20B: A Beginner’s Hands‑On Guide". The section 1-1 likely refers to the first subsection of section 1. We need to fill step_id, h2, md_intro, code_cells, exercise. Provide markdown intro and short code cells (<40 lines each). Include exercises where appropriate. Add seeds/random_state for reproducibility. Target 800-1500 tokens per section. Maintain 0.56 markdown ratio. So about 56% of tokens should be markdown. We need to produce JSON array. Likely multiple steps? Section 1-1 maybe has multiple steps? But we can create a single StepFillJSON object for the section. But the instruction says "Return JSON array of StepFillJSON objects". So maybe each step is a separate object. For section 1-1, maybe we need multiple steps: e.g., 1-1.1, 1-1.2, etc. But the instruction: "Fill sections 1-1" maybe means fill the entire section 1-1. We can create multiple steps: e.g., step_id "1-1-1", "1-1-2", etc. But we need to keep tokens 800-1500 per section. That might be too large for a single step. But we can create maybe 3 steps each ~300 tokens? But the instruction: "Target 800-1500 tokens per section". So each section should be 800-1500 tokens. So we need to produce a single StepFillJSON object that covers the entire section 1-1, with content 800-1500 tokens. But we can also include multiple steps within that section, but each step might be smaller. But the instruction says "Return JSON array of StepFillJSON objects". So we can return an array with e.g., 3 step objects inside the section 1-1. But each step would be a sub-step. But the tokens target is per section, not per step. So we can produce 3 steps each maybe 250-400 tokens, total ~800-1200 tokens. That satisfies. But we need to keep 0.56 markdown ratio. So about 56% of tokens should be markdown. We need to produce markdown intro and short code cells (<40 lines each). So we need to craft markdown and code cells accordingly.
>
>Let's design:
>
>Step 1: "1-1-1" - H2: "Installing the GPT-Oss-20B Toolkit". md_intro: explanation of prerequisites, pip install, environment. Provide small code cell to install. Provide exercise: "Verify installation".
>
>Step 2: "1-1-2" - H2: "Downloading the Model Weights". md_intro: explanation of huggingface, huggingface-cli, huggingface token, etc. Provide code cell to download. Provide exercise: "Check that the model folder exists".
>
>Step 3: "1-1-3" - H2: "Running a Simple Inference". md_intro: explanation of loading model with transformers, generating text. Provide code cell to load and generate. Provide exercise: "Generate a short story".
>
>Total tokens: Each step includes markdown and code cells. Let's approximate tokens: Each step maybe 300 tokens. 3 steps ~900 tokens. Good.
>
>We need to keep markdown ratio 0.56. So about 56% of tokens should be markdown. So we need to write enough markdown. Each step's md_intro maybe 150 tokens. Code cells maybe 50 tokens. So ratio maybe ~75%. We need to reduce markdown maybe. But we can adjust. Let's aim for 60% markdown. We can keep md_intro moderate.
>
>Also we need to include seeds/random_state for reproducibility. For inference, we can set seed for torch or random. Provide code cell with seed.
>
>Also we need to keep code cells <40 lines. We'll keep them short.
>
>Now produce JSON array with 3 objects.
>
>Let's craft content.
>
>Step 1:
>
>step_id: "1-1-1"
>h2: "Installing the GPT-Oss-20B Toolkit"
>md_intro: Some markdown: explain prerequisites, Python 3.8+, pip install transformers torch accelerate. Provide code cell: pip install.
>
>Exercise: title "Verify Installation", instructions: run a simple command to check torch and transformers import.
>
>Step 2:
>
>step_id: "1-1-2"
>h2: "Downloading the Model Weights"
>md_intro: explain huggingface hub, huggingface-cli login, huggingface token, huggingface_hub library. Provide code cell to download using huggingface_hub.snapshot_download. Provide exercise: "Confirm the model directory contains config.json, pytorch_model.bin".
>
>Step 3:
>
>step_id: "1-1-3"
>h2: "Running a Simple Inference"
>md_intro: explain loading with AutoModelForCausalLM and AutoTokenizer, set seed, generate text. Provide code cell. Provide exercise: "Generate a short story about a robot".
>
>Now produce JSON array. Ensure each object has step_id, h2, md_intro, code_cells (array), exercise (object). Each code cell: {lang, lines, max_lines}. Provide lines as array of strings. Provide max_lines maybe 20.
>
>Let's craft code cells.
>
>Step 1 code cell:
>
>lines:
>- "import sys"
>- "print(f'Python version: {sys.version}')"
>- "import torch"
>- "import transformers"
>- "print(f'Torch version: {torch.__version__}')"
>- "print(f'Transformers version: {transformers.__version__}')"
>
>But we also need pip install. Actually we can include pip install in a separate code cell. But we can combine? Let's separate: first code cell to install packages. But we can just show pip install command. But code cell lines cannot contain shell commands? But we can include them as lines. But maybe we can use "bash" language. But we only have one code cell? We can have multiple code cells? The spec says code_cells: [{lang, lines, max_lines}]. So we can have multiple code cells per step. So we can have two code cells: one for pip install, one for verification.
>
>But we need to keep each code cell <40 lines. That's fine.
>
>So Step 1:
>
>code_cells:
>1. {lang: "bash", lines: ["pip install --upgrade pip", "pip install torch==2.2.0 transformers accelerate"], max_lines: 20}
>2. {lang: "python", lines: [...], max_lines: 20}
>
>But we need to keep tokens. Let's craft.
>
>Now Step 2 code cell: download model.
>
>Use huggingface_hub library: pip install huggingface_hub. Then code to download.
>
>We can create two code cells: one for pip install huggingface_hub, second for download.
>
>Step 3 code cell: load model and generate.
>
>We can include seed setting.
>
>Now produce JSON array.
>
>We need to ensure we use proper JSON formatting. Strings need to escape quotes. We'll produce JSON array with objects.
>
>Let's craft content.
>
>We'll write md_intro as markdown text. Ensure not too long.
>
>Now produce final JSON.
