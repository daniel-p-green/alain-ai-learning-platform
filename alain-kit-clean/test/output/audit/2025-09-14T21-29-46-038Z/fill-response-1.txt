>We need to produce JSON array of StepFillJSON objects for sections 2-2 of a guide. The previous sections: 1 completed. So we need to fill sections 2-2. That likely means sub-section 2-2 within section 2. But we need to produce steps for section 2-2. The instructions: "Return JSON array of StepFillJSON objects with: step_id, h2, md_intro (markdown explanation) code_cells: [{lang, lines, max_lines}] exercise: {title, instructions} where appropriate Markdown intro + short code cells (<40 lines each) Include exercises where appropriate Add seeds/random_state for reproducibility Target 800-1500 tokens per section Maintain 0.56 markdown ratio Return valid JSON array of StepFillJSON objects. IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else."

>We need to produce JSON array. Each object corresponds to a step. For section 2-2. We need to decide what content. The guide: "Getting Started with GPT-Oss-20B: A Beginner’s Hands‑On Guide". Section 2 likely about environment setup, installation, maybe inference. 2-2 could be about "Running Inference on GPT-Oss-20B". So we need to provide steps: maybe 3-4 steps. Each step has step_id maybe "2-2-1", "2-2-2", etc. Provide h2 headings. Provide md_intro. Provide code_cells with lines array. Provide exercise if appropriate.
>
>Need to maintain 0.56 markdown ratio: meaning about 56% of the content should be markdown. The rest code. We target 800-1500 tokens per section. Since we have multiple steps, each step maybe 200-400 tokens. Let's aim for 4 steps each ~250 tokens, total ~1000 tokens. Good.
>
>We need to keep code cells short (<40 lines). Provide seeds for reproducibility: e.g., set random.seed(42) or use torch.manual_seed(42). Provide code for generating text with GPT-Oss-20B.
>
>We need to use "GPT-Oss-20B" presumably a huggingface model. Provide code using transformers pipeline or torch. Provide environment installation commands.
>
>We need to produce JSON array. Each object: step_id, h2, md_intro, code_cells, maybe exercise.

>Step 2-2-1: Install and Load GPT-Oss-20B
>
>Step 2-2-2: Basic Text Generation
>
>Step 2-2-3: Customizing Generation Parameters
>
>Step 2-2-4: Handling Long Contexts with Sliding Window
>
>Include an exercise in step 2-2-3: "Generate a short story with specific temperature".
>
>Add seeds: set random seed before generation.

>Let's craft md_intro for each step, about 200 tokens each.

The `transformers` library provides a high‑level interface to load the model and tokenizer.\n\nWe’ll also set a random seed to ensure reproducibility of any stochastic generation steps that follow.  Setting `torch.manual_seed(42)` guarantees that the same random numbers are produced each time you run the notebook.\n\n**Key commands:**\n\n1. Install the libraries.\n2.
