>We need to produce JSON array of StepFillJSON objects for sections 3-3. We have previous sections 2 completed. We need to fill sections 3-3. So presumably step 3-3 is a sub-section within section 3? The title: "Getting Started with GPT-Oss-20B: A Beginnerâ€™s Handsâ€‘On Guide". Section 3-3 likely refers to a step within section 3. But we are asked to fill sections 3-3. So we need to produce JSON array of StepFillJSON objects for that section. The JSON objects include fields: step_id, h2, md_intro, code_cells, exercise. We need to produce Markdown intro and short code cells (<40 lines each). Include exercises where appropriate. Add seeds/random_state for reproducibility. Target 800-1500 tokens per section. Maintain 0.56 markdown ratio. That's a lot of tokens. But we only need to produce JSON array of StepFillJSON objects. The tokens count refers to the content of the section? We need to produce 800-1500 tokens per section. That is a lot. But we only have to produce JSON objects. Each object may contain md_intro text. The md_intro can be long. We need to ensure markdown ratio 0.56. So about 56% of tokens should be markdown. We need to produce a long md_intro. Also code cells short.

>We need to produce maybe 3-4 steps within section 3-3? But the instruction: "Return JSON array of StepFillJSON objects with: - step_id, h2, md_intro (markdown explanation) - code_cells: [{lang, lines, max_lines}] - exercise: {title, instructions} where appropriate". So each step is a StepFillJSON object. We need to fill sections 3-3. That might be a single step? But maybe 3-3 has multiple sub-steps. The naming convention: step_id like "3-3-1"? The h2 is the subheading. We need to produce a series of steps that cover the content of section 3-3. The content is "Getting Started with GPT-Oss-20B: A Beginnerâ€™s Handsâ€‘On Guide". So section 3-3 might be about "Fine-tuning GPT-Oss-20B on custom data" or "Using GPT-Oss-20B for inference". But we don't know. We need to guess. The previous sections 2 completed. Section 3 likely covers "Installation and Setup". Section 3-3 might be "Running inference with GPT-Oss-20B". But we need to fill sections 3-3. Let's assume section 3-3 is about "Inference and evaluation". We need to produce steps: 3-3-1: Load the model, 3-3-2: Prepare input, 3-3-3: Generate text, 3-3-4: Evaluate output. Provide code cells and exercises.

The model is a 20â€‘billionâ€‘parameter causal language model, which means it predicts the next token in a sequence. We will use the ðŸ¤— `transformers` library, which provides a convenient API for downloading and caching the model weights. \n\n**Why GPU matters**: GPTâ€‘Ossâ€‘20B is too large to run efficiently on a CPU; youâ€™ll need a GPU with at least 16â€¯GB of VRAM. If you are on a cloud instance, make sure the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable is set correctly. \n\n**Reproducibility**: We set a global random seed for both PyTorch and the tokenizer to ensure that our examples produce the same results every time. \n\n**Memory considerations**: The model will be loaded in 16â€‘bit precision (`torch.float16`) by default to reduce memory usage. If you have a GPU with 24â€¯GB or more, you can switch to 32â€‘bit precision for slightly better numerical stability. \n\n**What weâ€™ll do**:\n1. Import the necessary libraries.\n2. Set the random seed.\n3. Load the tokenizer and model.\n4. Move the model to the GPU.\n5.

Encode the prompt into a tensor of token IDs.\n2. Move the tensor to the same device as the model.\n3.
