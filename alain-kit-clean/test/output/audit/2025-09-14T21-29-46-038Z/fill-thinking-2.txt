>We need to produce JSON array of StepFillJSON objects for sections 3-3. We have previous sections 2 completed. We need to fill sections 3-3. So presumably step 3-3 is a sub-section within section 3? The title: "Getting Started with GPT-Oss-20B: A Beginner’s Hands‑On Guide". Section 3-3 likely refers to a step within section 3. But we are asked to fill sections 3-3. So we need to produce JSON array of StepFillJSON objects for that section. The JSON objects include fields: step_id, h2, md_intro, code_cells, exercise. We need to produce Markdown intro and short code cells (<40 lines each). Include exercises where appropriate. Add seeds/random_state for reproducibility. Target 800-1500 tokens per section. Maintain 0.56 markdown ratio. That's a lot of tokens. But we only need to produce JSON array of StepFillJSON objects. The tokens count refers to the content of the section? We need to produce 800-1500 tokens per section. That is a lot. But we only have to produce JSON objects. Each object may contain md_intro text. The md_intro can be long. We need to ensure markdown ratio 0.56. So about 56% of tokens should be markdown. We need to produce a long md_intro. Also code cells short.
