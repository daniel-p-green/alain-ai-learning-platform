>We need to produce JSON matching OutlineJSON schema. The schema not provided but we can infer fields: title, level, objectives, prereqs, setup_steps, steps, data_sources, references, metadata. Steps: each with heading, description, token_estimate. Provide 8-10 sections. Provide token estimates. Provide target_tokens 4500-7500. target_markdown_ratio 0.56. estimated_read_time maybe minutes.
