Think of it like a question or instruction in everyday conversation. The model reads your prompt and writes a reply that follows the instructions.\n\n**Key idea:**  \n- **Clear, concise language → more accurate answers.**  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Basic Prompt Structure <a name=\"basic-prompt-structure\"></a>\n\nA good prompt usually has three parts:\n\n| Part | Purpose | Example |\n|------|---------|---------|\n| **1️⃣ Context** | Gives background so the model knows *who* it is and *what* it's doing. | “You are a friendly travel guide.” |\n| **2️⃣ Instruction** | Tells the model what to do. | “List three must‑see attractions in Kyoto.” |\n| **3️⃣ Question/Request** | The specific thing you want answered or created. | “Include opening hours and best times to visit.” |\n\nPutting it together:\n\n```\nYou are a friendly travel guide.\nPlease list three must‑see attractions in Kyoto, including their opening hours and the best time of day to visit each.\n```\n\n> **Tip:** If your task is very short (e.g., “What’s the capital of France?”) you can skip the context part.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Getting Started: Simple Example Prompts <a name=\"getting-started\"></a>\n\nBelow are a handful of beginner‑friendly prompts that illustrate how to use the structure above. Try typing each into your GPT‑OSS interface and see what comes back!\n\n| # | Prompt | What You’ll Learn |\n|---|--------|--------------------|\n| 1️⃣ | **“What is the capital of France?”** | Direct question → quick fact. |\n| 2️⃣ | **“Explain photosynthesis in simple terms.”** | Instruction + topic → explanatory answer. |\n| 3️⃣ | **“You are a helpful assistant. Create a grocery list for two people: milk, eggs, bread.”** | Context + instruction + request. |\n| 4️⃣ | **“Summarize the plot of *The Great Gatsby* in three sentences.”** | Instruction + formatting constraint. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Common Pitfalls & How to Avoid Them <a name=\"common-pitfalls\"></a>\n\n| # | Pitfall | Why It Happens | Fix |\n|---|---------|----------------|-----|\n| 1️⃣ | **Too vague questions** (e.g., “Tell me something.”) | The model has no direction. | Add specifics: “Give three facts about the solar system.” |\n| 2️⃣ | **Overly long prompts** with many unrelated requests | Model may miss the main goal. | Break into separate prompts or use bullet points for clarity. |\n| 3️⃣ | **Ambiguous wording** (e.g., “Explain that.”) | The model can’t know which “that” you mean. | Use precise nouns: “Explain how a combustion engine works.” |\n| 4️⃣ | **Mixing multiple tasks in one line** (e.g., “Give me the recipe and explain why it’s healthy.”) | Model may skip or mishandle part of the request. | Separate into two prompts or use clear delimiters like `---`. |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Best Practices for Clear Prompts <a name=\"best-practices\"></a>\n\n| Practice | How to Do It |\n|----------|--------------|\n| **Be Specific** | Instead of “Tell me about dogs,” ask “What are the top three health issues in Golden Retrievers?” |\n| **Ask One Thing at a Time** | If you need an explanation *and* a list, split them. |\n| **Use Simple Language** | Avoid jargon unless it’s necessary for the task. |\n| **Provide Examples (Optional)** | “List 5 fruits. Example: Apple.” Helps set format expectations. |\n| **Keep it Short When Possible** | Lengthy prompts can confuse the model. Aim for <200 words if you’re new. |\n| **Check Output Format** | If you want bullet points, say so explicitly. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Interactive Examples – Try It Yourself! <a name=\"interactive-examples\"></a>\n\nFeel free to copy‑paste these into GPT‑OSS and experiment with tweaking the wording.\n\n### Example A: Create a Simple Story Prompt\n\n```\nYou are a creative writer. Write a short story (≈120 words) about a cat who learns to play piano.\n```\n\n*Try variations:* change “cat” to “parrot,” or ask for a *twist ending.*\n\n---\n\n### Example B: Ask for a Recipe\n\n```\nYou are a kitchen helper. Give me a quick recipe for spaghetti with tomato sauce, suitable for 4 people. Include cooking time and key ingredients.\n```\n\n*Try adding:* “Add a side salad suggestion.”\n\n---\n\n### Example C: Summarize an Article\n\n```\nPlease summarize the following paragraph in two sentences:\n> “Artificial intelligence is transforming many industries by automating repetitive tasks, improving data analysis, and providing new ways to interact with customers.” \n```\n\n*(Replace the paragraph with something you care about.)*\n\n---\n\n## 7.
