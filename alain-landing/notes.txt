Implementation notes

- Where to replace [LIKE_THIS] placeholders:
  - Hero CTAs, footer links, and resource links: replace each href or mailto with real URLs.
  - Demo targets: model_link, colab_link, repo_link, and email can mirror the JSON placeholders.

- Alternates and imagine hook rotator:
  - Alternates are stored in <template id="alternateSlogans"> and imagine hooks in <template id="imagineOptions">.
  - To swap alternates into the hero, replace the hero subhead text manually or script a rotator similar to the imagine hook.
  - To disable the imagine rotator, remove the final IIFE or wrap it with if(false){...}.

- Adding more icons:
  - Follow the inline SVG style: thin strokes, blueprint blue (#1f4ab8), simple geometry, include <title> for accessibility.

- Accessibility & focus:
  - All sections use semantic landmarks. Focus states are visible (orange outline) and menus/accordion are keyboard-operable.
  - Ensure link text remains short (1â€“3 words) for scanning; keep contrast at AA or better.

- Extending:
  - To externalize CSS, move the <style> block into assets.css and include a <link rel="stylesheet"> in <head>.
  - Keep JS minimal; prefer progressive enhancement.
