Think of the model as a giant Lego set that needs to be assembled by a team of builders spread across a factory floor. Each builder (GPU) works on a part of the set, and they must share pieces (weights, activations) to finish the build. In deep learning, the three main ways to split this work are **data parallelism**, **pipeline parallelism**, and **tensor parallelism**.\n",

This is the simplest form of parallelism and scales linearly with the number of GPUs, but it still requires each GPU to hold the entire model.\n",

A batch of tokens flows through the pipeline, with each stage computing its part before passing the activations downstream. This reduces per‑GPU memory but introduces *pipeline stalls* when stages are imbalanced.\n",
