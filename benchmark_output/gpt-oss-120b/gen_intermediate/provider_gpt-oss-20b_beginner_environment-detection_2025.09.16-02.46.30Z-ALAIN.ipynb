        "# Step 1: Introduction and Environment Setup\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to the first step of our journey to deploy and fine‑tune the **GPT‑OSS‑20B** model. Think of GPT‑OSS‑20B as a gigantic library of 20 billion words, each page written by a team of researchers. Our goal is to teach this library how to answer questions about your specific domain—just like training a student to become an expert in a niche subject.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why this setup matters\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we can start training, we need a clean, reproducible environment. Reproducibility is the practice of ensuring that anyone who follows these instructions can get the same results, down to the exact random numbers used during training. In machine learning, a single line of code that shuffles data can change the final model’s performance by a few percent. By pinning library versions, setting a fixed random seed, and handling errors gracefully, we make our notebook a reliable recipe.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key terms explained\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Tokenizer** – The component that turns raw text into a sequence of integer tokens that the model can understand. It’s like a translator that converts words into a language the model speaks.\n",
        "- **Accelerate** – A lightweight library from Hugging Face that abstracts away the complexities of distributed training (e.g., multi‑GPU or multi‑node setups). It lets you write a single training script that runs on any hardware.\n",
        "- **FastAPI** – A modern, fast web framework for building APIs in Python. It’s used later to expose the fine‑tuned model as a REST endpoint.\n",
        "- **Docker** – A containerization platform that packages your code, dependencies, and environment into a portable image. This ensures the model runs the same way on your laptop, a cloud VM, or a Kubernetes cluster.\n",
        "- **HF_TOKEN** – Your Hugging Face API token. It authenticates you to download models and datasets from the Hugging Face Hub.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rationale & trade‑offs\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pinning versions**: We lock `transformers==4.30.0`, `torch==2.0.0`, and `accelerate==0.21.0`. This prevents accidental upgrades that might introduce breaking changes. The trade‑off is that you may need to wait for newer features, but stability is paramount for reproducibility.\n",
        "- **Setting a seed**: We use `torch.manual_seed(42)` and `random.seed(42)`. This guarantees that random operations (e.g., data shuffling) produce the same outcome each run. The downside is that the model might not explore as diverse a training trajectory, but for a tutorial we want consistent results.\n",
        "- **Error handling in installation**: We wrap `pip install` calls in a try/except block so that the notebook continues gracefully if a package is already installed or if a network hiccup occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Quick sanity check\n",
        "\n",
        "After the environment is ready, we’ll run a tiny test: load the GPT‑OSS‑20B tokenizer and encode a short sentence. If that works, we’re good to go!\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Tip**: If you’re on a machine without a GPU, the notebook will still run, but training will be extremely slow. Consider using a cloud GPU instance or a local GPU if you plan to fine‑tune.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Warning**: The GPT‑OSS‑20B model is large (~20 GB of weights). Loading it on a machine with less than 32 GB of RAM will cause out‑of‑memory errors. Use the tokenizer only for the sanity check.\n",

        "\n",
        "Imagine a gigantic library where every book is a *layer* of knowledge. GPT‑OSS‑20B is built from **20 billion** such books, each one a transformer block that learns to read and write text. In this section we’ll walk through the main components that make this library tick, using everyday analogies to keep the concepts clear while still using the precise terminology you’ll need for fine‑tuning.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Transformer Blocks – The Library’s Reading Rooms\n",
        "\n",
        "Each transformer block is like a reading room where a group of librarians (the *attention heads*) simultaneously read the same paragraph (the input tokens). They share their insights, then combine them into a new, richer paragraph. The block has two main parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Self‑Attention** – Think of it as a group discussion where each librarian looks at every other librarian’s notes. The *scaled dot‑product attention* computes how much each token should pay attention to every other token, producing a weighted sum of the token embeddings.\n",
        "2. **Feed‑Forward Network (FFN)** – After the discussion, each librarian writes a short note (a two‑layer MLP) that refines the paragraph further.\n",
        "\n",
        "The block also uses **Layer Normalization** and **Residual Connections** to keep the information flowing smoothly, just like a hallway that lets you walk back and forth between rooms without getting lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Positional Encoding – The Library Map\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformers don’t have a sense of order by default, so we add *positional embeddings* that act like a map indicating where each book (token) sits in the sequence. GPT‑OSS‑20B uses *learned positional embeddings* rather than sinusoidal ones, giving the model flexibility to adjust the map during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Token Embedding – The Library’s Catalog\n",
        "\n",
        "Before any reading can happen, raw text is converted into integer IDs by the tokenizer. These IDs are then mapped to dense vectors via the **token embedding matrix**. Think of this as a catalog that turns a book’s title into a detailed description the librarians can understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Output Head – The Library’s Librarian\n",
        "\n",
        "After passing through all the reading rooms, the final hidden state is projected back into vocabulary space using a **language modeling head** (a linear layer tied to the token embeddings). This head predicts the next token in the sequence, enabling the model to generate coherent text.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Extra Explanatory Paragraph – Key Terms & Trade‑offs\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Attention Heads**: Parallel sub‑networks that focus on different relationships between tokens. More heads can capture richer patterns but increase memory usage.\n",
        "- **LayerNorm vs. BatchNorm**: LayerNorm normalizes across the feature dimension, making it suitable for variable‑length sequences and small batch sizes, which is why it’s preferred in transformers.\n",
        "- **Residual Connections**: Add the block’s input to its output, helping gradients flow during training and preventing vanishing‑gradient problems.\n",
        "- **Learned vs. Sinusoidal Positional Embeddings**: Learned embeddings can adapt to the dataset but require extra parameters; sinusoidal embeddings are parameter‑free and generalize better to longer sequences.\n",
        "- **Parameter Count Trade‑off**: GPT‑OSS‑20B’s 20 billion parameters give it strong language understanding but demand large GPU memory and longer inference times. Techniques like *quantization* or *model pruning* can reduce size at the cost of a slight drop in accuracy.\n",
