For fact‑checking or technical explanations, a low temperature (0.2‑0.3) keeps the model grounded. For brainstorming, creative writing, or exploring possibilities, a higher temperature (0.7‑0.9) can spark novel ideas but may also introduce noise. Top‑p works hand‑in‑hand with temperature—lower top‑p tightens the word pool, higher top‑p expands it. Max tokens should be set to just enough to cover the answer without truncation, and a seed is useful when you need consistent outputs for demos or unit tests.\n",

        "Imagine you’re a traveler in a big city. Before you start walking, you look at a map that shows the main streets, the landmarks you want to visit, and the best route to get there. That map is your *tool preamble* for GPT‑5. It tells the model what the user’s goal is, what tools it can use, and a high‑level plan for how to get there.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why a Preamble Helps\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Clarity**: Just like a map removes guesswork, a preamble removes ambiguity about *why* the model should call a tool.\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: The model can skip the \"I’m not sure what to do\" step and jump straight to the next tool.\n",
        "- **Safety**: By explicitly listing allowed tools, you prevent the model from calling something it shouldn’t.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Terms (and why they matter)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Tool Preamble**: A short, friendly description that appears before the user message. It sets the goal, lists available tools, and outlines a plan.\n",
        "- **Tool**: A pre‑defined function the model can invoke, such as `search`, `calculator`, or `weather`. Think of it as a kitchen appliance the chef can use.\n",
        "- **Tool Call**: The actual request the model sends to the tool, including arguments.\n",
        "- **Plan**: A step‑by‑step outline of how the model will reach the goal, often expressed in plain English.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Rationale & Trade‑offs\n",
        "\n",
        "A concise preamble is like a good GPS route: it gives you enough information to stay on track without overwhelming you with details. If the preamble is too long, the model may waste tokens parsing it and might even misinterpret the priority of steps. On the other hand, a very short preamble can leave the model guessing what tools are allowed, which can lead to unexpected or unsafe calls. The sweet spot is a 1‑2 sentence preamble that lists the goal, the tools, and a simple plan.\n",
