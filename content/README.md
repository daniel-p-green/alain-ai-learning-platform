# ALAIN Content Directory

This directory contains organized content generated by ALAIN, structured for easy navigation and discovery.

Note: The repository is configured to ignore all files under `content/` except this README. Generated artifacts are created at runtime or via scripts and should not be committed. See `.gitignore` rules in the repo root.

## Notebook Organization

Auto-saved notebooks are grouped by provider/model/difficulty/date for easy browsing and cleanup. Each file has an adjacent `*.meta.json` with checksum and context.

## Research Format

- JSON for complete, structured data (`research-data.json`).
- Markdown for human-readable summaries (`model-card.md`, `huggingface-info.md`, `openai-cookbook.md`, `unsloth-content.md`).

## Programmatic Index

- The API `GET /api/content/index` lists provider/model artifacts in this tree.
- Add `?flat=1` to return a flat array instead of grouped by provider.

## Usage

- Browse notebooks by provider and model.
- Each notebook includes adjacent `.meta.json` with provenance.
- Research folders combine JSON (programmatic) and Markdown (human-readable) artifacts.
