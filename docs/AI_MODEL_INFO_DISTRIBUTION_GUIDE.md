# Guide to AI Model Information Distribution

Last updated: 2025-09-13

## Introduction

AI models are most useful when developers can easily find reliable information about them. Model creators ("model makers") use platforms and documentation formats to share details about architecture, training, usage, and limitations. In recent years, centralized model hubs and standardized documentation (model cards) have emerged to make models more accessible and transparent. This guide summarizes how and where model information is distributed — from popular hubs like Hugging Face to code repositories, model cards, official docs, and community aggregators — and serves as a directory of key resources.

## Key Platforms for Model Information

### 1) Model Hubs and Repositories

Model hubs host and share pretrained models with metadata and documentation, improving discoverability and reuse. The Hugging Face Hub has become a central repository across many ML tasks, offering versioning, discussions, and Markdown model cards.

Other notable hubs/repositories include:
- TensorFlow Hub (tfhub.dev): Model pages with purpose and usage, often with Colab links.
- PyTorch Hub: Mechanism (`torch.hub`) to load models from GitHub repositories; authors commonly host code and weights on GitHub.
- ONNX Model Zoo: Historical collection of ONNX-format models; many community models are also available on Hugging Face.
- Framework/Org model zoos: e.g., TensorFlow Model Garden, Keras Applications, and NVIDIA NGC. These remain useful in specific contexts (e.g., GPU-optimized checkpoints) though broad discoverability is often strongest on open hubs.

Typical artifacts on these hubs include pretrained weights, licenses, task/framework tags, and documentation. On Hugging Face, a repository’s `README.md` renders as its model card. Many hubs integrate with libraries (e.g., `transformers`, `tensorflow_hub`) for programmatic loading by name.

### 2) Code Repositories (GitHub and others)

Open-source code repositories remain fundamental for sharing model implementations. Alongside papers or announcements, authors often publish:
- Model architecture code and training scripts
- Instructions to reproduce or download pretrained weights
- Usage examples and configuration details in the README or wiki

GitHub organizations (e.g., OpenAI, Meta AI, EleutherAI) frequently host official implementations. Community-curated lists (e.g., "awesome-*" lists) also aggregate links to notable model repos.

### 3) Model Cards and Standard Documentation

Model cards standardize model documentation, describing intended use, performance, limitations, and key facts. Widely adopted since Mitchell et al. (2018), model cards support discoverability and responsible use.

On Hugging Face, every model repo is expected to include a model card (`README.md`). Recommended sections include intended uses and limitations (including bias/ethics notes), training data, parameters, and evaluation metrics. Templates and annotated examples are provided by Hugging Face. Google’s Model Card Toolkit (MCT) helps generate model cards from a schema and can integrate into ML pipelines (e.g., TFX) to automate documentation.

### 4) Official Developer Documentation and Guides

Commercial/API models publish information via official docs portals and guidebooks, focusing on how to integrate and use the models rather than internals:
- OpenAI: API docs and the OpenAI Cookbook (examples, best practices)
- Anthropic, Cohere, and others: API references, quickstarts, and usage guides
- System cards / safety reports: In-depth capability, evaluation, and safety details for advanced systems (e.g., GPT-4 system card)

### 5) Community Resources and Aggregators

Community sites help discover models and connect papers, code, and checkpoints:
- Papers with Code: Links papers to code and results; leaderboards by task
- arXiv: Primary source for research papers; many pages include a "Code" section (via Papers with Code)
- Hugging Face Spaces and task filters: Live demos and browsing by pipeline/task
- "Awesome" lists and forums: Curated directories maintained by the community

## Using the Directory

- If you’ve built a new model: publish on a hub (e.g., Hugging Face), include a model card (consider automating with MCT), release code on GitHub, and link from the paper (arXiv) so Papers with Code and others can index it.
- If you’re searching for a model: read the model card or README first; then check for a GitHub repo, official vendor docs (for API models), and aggregators like Papers with Code for implementation and benchmark context.

## Notes and Caveats

- Platform links and offerings evolve; verify current guidance on each site.
- Prefer primary sources (official docs, model cards, and repos) when accuracy is critical.
- Document intended use, limitations, dataset provenance, and evaluation metrics to support responsible use.
