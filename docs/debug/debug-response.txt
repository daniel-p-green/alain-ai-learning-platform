**TinyLlama‑1.1B‑Chat‑v1.0 (GGUF)**  
*Model page:* <https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF>  

Below is a quick‑start guide that covers:

| What you’ll need | How to get it | Typical use‑case |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Model file** (`tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.gguf`) | Download from the Hugging Face link (or via `git lfs pull`) | Chat‑style generation, lightweight inference on a single GPU or even CPU |
| **Inference engine** | `llama.cpp` (C++), `llama-cpp-python`, or `transformers` (via `AutoModelForCausalLM` + `AutoTokenizer`) | Fast, low‑memory inference |
| **Hardware** | 4 GB+ VRAM (GPU) or 8 GB+ RAM (CPU) | Works comfortably on a mid‑range laptop or a small server |

---

## 1. Downloading the Model

```bash
# Option 1: Hugging Face CLI (requires authentication)
huggingface-cli login
huggingface-cli download TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF --local-dir ./tinyllama

# Option 2: Git LFS (if you have it installed)
git clone https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF
cd TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF
git lfs pull
```

The file you’ll use is `tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.gguf`.

---

## 2. Running with **llama.cpp** (C++)

```bash
# Build llama.cpp if you haven’t already
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
make

# Run inference
./main -m ../tinyllama/tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.gguf \
      -p "Hello, TinyLlama! How are you today?" \
      -n 128
```

**Tips**

- `-n 128` → max tokens to generate.  
- `-t 4` → number of threads (adjust for your CPU).  
- `-c 512` → context size (default 512, can be increased if you have more RAM).

---

## 3. Running with **llama‑cpp‑python**

```python
# pip install llama-cpp-python
from llama_cpp import Llama

model = Llama(
    model_path="tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.gguf",
    n_ctx=512,          # context window
    n_threads=4,        # CPU threads
    temperature=0.7,    # creativity
)

prompt = "You are a helpful assistant. What is the capital of France?"
output = model(prompt, max_tokens=50, stop=["\n"])
print(output["choices"][0]["text"])
```

**Batching**  
You can pass a list of prompts to `model()` for parallel inference.

---

## 4. Running with **🤗 Transformers** (via `AutoModelForCausalLM`)

> **Note:** The GGUF format is not directly supported by `transformers`.  
> You need to convert it to a PyTorch checkpoint or use `llama-cpp-python` as a backend.

```python
# Convert GGUF to a PyTorch checkpoint (once)
# (Requires the `llama.cpp` repo with the `gguf_to_pytorch.py` script)
# This step is optional if you prefer to stay with GGUF.

# Example: Using the GGUF via llama-cpp-python as a custom backend
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF")
pipe = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model="TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF",
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    device=0,  # GPU id or -1 for CPU
)

print(pipe("Tell me a joke about cats.", max_new_tokens=50))
```

---

## 5. Quick Chat Example (Python)

```python
from llama_cpp import Llama

llama = Llama(
    model_path="tinyllama-1.1b-chat-v1.0.gguf",
    n_ctx=512,
    temperature=0.6,
)

chat_history = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a friendly assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi!"},
]

def build_prompt(history):
    prompt = ""
    for turn in history:
        role = turn["role"]
        content = turn["content"]
        if role == "system":
            prompt += f"[SYSTEM] {content}\n"
        elif role == "assistant":
            prompt += f"[ASSISTANT] {content}\n"
        else:
            prompt += f"[USER] {content}\n"
    prompt += "[ASSISTANT] "
    return prompt

while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    chat_history.append({"role": "user", "content": user_input})
    prompt = build_prompt(chat_history)
    response = llama(prompt, max_tokens=200)["choices"][0]["text"]
    print(f"Assistant: {response.strip()}")
    chat_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.strip()})
```

## 6. Performance & Resource Estimates

| Platform | VRAM (GPU) | CPU RAM | Approx. Latency (per 50‑token prompt) |
|----------|------------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| RTX 3060 (12 GB) | 4 GB | – | 0.3 s |
| RTX 2080 Ti (11 GB) | 4 GB | – | 0.4 s |
| 16 GB RAM laptop | – | 8 GB | 1.2 s (single‑thread) |
| 32 GB RAM server | – | 16 GB | 0.6 s (8 threads) |

*These are rough averages; actual latency depends on batch size, temperature, and hardware.*

---

## 7. Licensing & Usage

- **Model**: `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0` is released under the **Apache‑2.0** license (check the `LICENSE` file on the Hugging Face page).  
- **Quantization**: The GGUF file is 4‑bit quantized, which reduces memory usage but may slightly affect quality.  
- **Commercial use**: Allowed under Apache‑2.0, but always double‑check the license text if you plan to embed it in a product.

---

## 8. Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| “CUDA out of memory” | Model too large for GPU | Reduce `n_ctx` or use CPU (`device=-1`) |
| “Segmentation fault” | Mismatched `llama.cpp` build | Rebuild with `make clean && make` |
| “Tokenization mismatch” | Using wrong tokenizer | Ensure you use the same tokenizer that shipped with the GGUF (usually `TheBloke/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0-GGUF`) |
| “Slow inference” | Too many threads on CPU | Lower `n_threads` or use GPU |

---

## 9. Next Steps

1. **Fine‑tune**: If you need domain‑specific knowledge, consider fine‑tuning the GGUF with `llama.cpp`’s `quantize` or using a higher‑level framework like `trl` (though you’ll need to convert back to a PyTorch checkpoint).  
2. **Deploy**: Wrap the inference in a FastAPI or Flask endpoint for web or mobile apps.  
3. **Benchmark**: Use `llama.cpp`’s built‑in benchmarking (`./main -m model.gguf -b 128 -t 4 -n 128 -p "benchmark"`) to get precise latency numbers for your setup.

---

### TL;DR

- **TinyLlama‑1.1B‑Chat‑v1.0** is a 1.1 B‑parameter, chat‑optimized model in GGUF format.  
- Download the `.gguf` file from Hugging Face.  
- Run it with `llama.cpp`, `llama‑cpp‑python`, or via a custom backend in `transformers`.  
- Works comfortably on a mid‑range GPU or even a CPU with 8 GB RAM.  
- Licensed under Apache‑2.0 – free for commercial use.
