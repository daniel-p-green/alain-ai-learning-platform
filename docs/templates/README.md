Teaching-focused templates

- `teaching_template.ipynb`: A vendor-agnostic, teaching-optimized starter notebook.

Use it by copying into your project or opening directly in Colab. It includes:
- Clear outcomes, prerequisites, and time estimate
- Setup, secrets, minimal API calls (OpenAI/Anthropic), and evaluation cells
- Cost/usage guidance, troubleshooting, and exercises

Tip: Pair with docs in `alain-ai-learning-platform/docs/notebooks/notebook-best-practices.md` and the checklist in `alain-ai-learning-platform/docs/notebooks/notebook-quality-checklist.md`.
