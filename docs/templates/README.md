Teaching-focused templates

- `teaching_template.ipynb`: A vendor-agnostic, teaching-optimized starter notebook.
- `gpt-oss_active_learning_template.ipynb`: Specialized for GPT‑OSS (OpenAI‑compatible local chat), includes MCQs, golden set eval, token/latency logging, Colab forms, and troubleshooting diagnostics.

Use it by copying into your project or opening directly in Colab. It includes:
- Clear outcomes, prerequisites, and time estimate
- Setup, secrets, minimal API calls (OpenAI/Anthropic), and evaluation cells
- Cost/usage guidance, troubleshooting, and exercises
