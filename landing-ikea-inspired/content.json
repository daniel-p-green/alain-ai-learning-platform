    "Imagine IKEA, but only rich teams get instruction manuals. Everyone else gets a box of parts. That is AI today. Alain changes that.",
    "Imagine every model on Hugging Face being as easy to use as GPT-4. Documentation that writes itself. A level field.",
    "Imagine spending $500K training a model that nobody uses because you cannot afford documentation. Multiply by 100 launches a month. Alain stops that."
  ],
  "narrative_blocks": {
    "problem": "Today, models ship faster than teams can learn. Docs become guesses, retries, and delays. Adoption clusters around a few providers, while the long tail, often cheaper or better for specific jobs, gets ignored.",
    "solution": "Alain is the open‑source blueprint layer for all models. Think IKEA for AI. Models are the raw materials. Alain is the instruction booklet that turns them into things you use every day.",
    "demo": "Here’s Alain. I paste a model link. Alain ingests the card and repo, then generates a runnable notebook: setup, key concepts, examples, and quick MCQs. Guardrails and citations included. One‑click to run in Colab or locally. It even teaches model‑specific quirks, like when to use harmony prompting versus completions.",
    "three_builds": "Three fast builds. One, localization: the same model becomes a Portuguese lesson with checkpoints, lowering barriers for non‑English teams. Two, evaluation and ranking: a side‑by‑side template that tracks quality, latency,and cost across models so teams can choose the right fit and re‑validate over time. Three, onboarding: new hires get a starter pack that turns docs into day‑one workflows. Safety is built‑in: linting, required citations, and a local‑first option via Ollama so teams can learn without sending data out.",
    "analogy": "IKEA without instructions is just wood and screws. AI without blueprints is just models and docs. Alain turns raw materials into daily furniture: your evaluation bench, your team’s onboarding desk, your customer demo table.",
    "results": "In pilots, teams cut retries by roughly two‑thirds and reached first good output 30 to 40 percent faster.",
    "closing": "Raw models are raw materials. Alain turns any model into a daily workflow. Paste link. Get lesson. Run it. Reuse it. After this, raw docs feel unusable."
