# Introduction

We present  **Tongyi DeepResearch**, an agentic large language model featuring 30 billion total parameters, with only 3 billion activated per token. Developed by Tongyi Lab, the model is specifically designed for **long-horizon, deep information-seeking** tasks. Tongyi-DeepResearch demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across a range of agentic search benchmarks, including Humanity's Last Exam, BrowserComp, BrowserComp-ZH, WebWalkerQA, GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch and FRAMES.

More details can be found in our üì∞ [Tech Blog](https://tongyi-agent.github.io/blog/introducing-tongyi-deep-research).

## Key Features

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Fully automated synthetic data generation pipeline**: We design a highly scalable data synthesis pipeline, which is fully automatic and empowers agentic pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning.
- üîÑ **Large-scale continual pre-training on agentic data**: Leveraging diverse, high-quality agentic interaction data to extend model capabilities, maintain freshness, and strengthen reasoning performance.
- üîÅ **End-to-end reinforcement learning**: We employ a strictly on-policy RL approach based on a customized Group Relative Policy Optimization framework, with token-level policy gradients, leave-one-out advantage estimation, and selective filtering of negative samples to stabilize training in a non‚Äëstationary environment.
- ü§ñ **Agent Inference Paradigm Compatibility**: At inference, Tongyi-DeepResearch is compatible with two inference paradigms: ReAct, for rigorously evaluating the model's core intrinsic abilities, and an IterResearch-based 'Heavy' mode, which uses a test-time scaling strategy to unlock the model's maximum performance ceiling.
