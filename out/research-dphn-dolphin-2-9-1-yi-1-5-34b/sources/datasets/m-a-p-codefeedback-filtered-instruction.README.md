## OpenCodeInterpreter
OpenCodeInterpreter is a family of open-source code generation systems designed to bridge the gap between large language models and advanced proprietary systems like the GPT-4 Code Interpreter. It significantly advances code generation capabilities by integrating execution and iterative refinement functionalities.

For further information and related work, refer to our paper: ["OpenCodeInterpreter: A System for Enhanced Code Generation and Execution"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14658) available on arXiv.

## Dataset Description

CodeFeedback-Filtered-Instruction is a curated collection of code instruction queries extracted from four prominent open-source code instruction tuning datasets: [Magicoder-OSS-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ise-uiuc/Magicoder-OSS-Instruct-75K), [Python code subset of ShareGPT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ajibawa-2023/Python-Code-23k-ShareGPT), [Magicoder-Evol-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ise-uiuc/Magicoder-Evol-Instruct-110K), and [Evol-Instruct-Code](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nickrosh/Evol-Instruct-Code-80k-v1). 
Initially, 287k queries were aggregated from these datasets. To isolate the most intricate and informative instructions, a rigorous filtering process was employed. 
This involved utilizing the Qwen-72B-Chat, an open-source chat model, for selective filtering. 
The code queries are evaluated along with their corresponding responses within the compiled datasets by the LLM, assigning a complexity score ranging from 1 to 5, and only those rated 4 or 5 were retained for the seed set. 
This meticulous filtering process resulted in a final collection of 156k high-quality single-turn code instructions.

In subsequent processing steps mentioned in the paper, besides Single-turn Packing, we exclusively utilized queries without considering responses. However, here we retained all responses to provide users with more convenient usage options.
