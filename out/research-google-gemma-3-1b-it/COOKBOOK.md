# COOKBOOK

### Usage

Below, there are some code snippets on how to get quickly started with running the model. First, install the Transformers library. Gemma 3 is supported starting from transformers 4.50.0. 

```sh
$ pip install -U transformers
```

Then, copy the snippet from the section that is relevant for your use case.


## Usage and Limitations

These models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.


### Intended Usage

Open vision-language models (VLMs) models have a wide range of applications
across various industries and domains. The following list of potential uses is
not comprehensive. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information
about the possible use-cases that the model creators considered as part of model
training and development.

-   Content Creation and Communication
    -   Text Generation: These models can be used to generate creative text
        formats such as poems, scripts, code, marketing copy, and email drafts.
    -   Chatbots and Conversational AI: Power conversational interfaces
        for customer service, virtual assistants, or interactive applications.
    -   Text Summarization: Generate concise summaries of a text corpus,
        research papers, or reports.
    -   Image Data Extraction: These models can be used to extract,
        interpret, and summarize visual data for text communications.
-   Research and Education
    -   Natural Language Processing (NLP) and VLM Research: These
        models can serve as a foundation for researchers to experiment with VLM
        and NLP techniques, develop algorithms, and contribute to the
        advancement of the field.
    -   Language Learning Tools: Support interactive language learning
        experiences, aiding in grammar correction or providing writing practice.
    -   Knowledge Exploration: Assist researchers in exploring large
        bodies of text by generating summaries or answering questions about
        specific topics.
