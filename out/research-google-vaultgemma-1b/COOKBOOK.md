## Usage and Limitations

These models have certain limitations that users should be aware of.


### Intended Usage

VaultGemma is intended for a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) applications. The purpose of this list is to provide contextual information about possible use cases that the model creators considered.

-   Privacy-Preserving NLP Research: Serve as a strong baseline for researchers to experiment with privacy-preserving techniques, develop new algorithms, and fine-tune models on sensitive data.
-   Applications with Sensitive Data: Can be fine-tuned on private or sensitive datasets (e.g., in healthcare, finance) where it is critical that the base model itself does not carry risks from public pre-training data.
-   Content Creation and Communication: Generate creative text, power chatbots, and summarize documents in scenarios where data privacy is a primary concern.
