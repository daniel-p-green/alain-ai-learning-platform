  point.

  2. The Stack is regularly updated to enact validated data removal requests. By
  clicking on "Access repository", you agree to update your own version of The
  Stack to the most recent usable version specified by the maintainers in [the
  following
  thread](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack/discussions/7). If
  you have questions about dataset versions and allowed uses, please also ask
  them in the datasetâ€™s [community
  discussions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack/discussions/new).
  We will also notify users via email when the latest usable version changes.

  3. To host, share, or otherwise provide access to The Stack dataset, you must

# StarCoder Training Dataset

## Dataset description
This is the dataset used for training [StarCoder](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoder) and [StarCoderBase](https://huggingface.co/bigcode/starcoderbase). It contains 783GB of code in 86 programming languages, and includes 54GB GitHub Issues + 13GB Jupyter notebooks in scripts and text-code pairs,
and 32GB of GitHub commits, which is approximately 250 Billion tokens.

## Dataset creation
The creation and filtering of The Stack is explained in the [original dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack-dedup), we additionally decontaminate and clean all 86 programming
languages in the dataset, in addition to GitHub issues, Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub commits. We also apply near-deduplication and remove PII, all details are mentionned in our [Paper: ðŸ’« StarCoder, May The Source Be With You](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cN-b9GnWtHzQRoE7M7gAEyivY0kl4BYs/view)

## How to use the dataset
```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# to load python for example
ds = load_dataset("bigcode/starcoderdata", data_dir="python", split="train")
```

GitHub issues, GitHub commits and Jupyter notebooks subsets have different columns from the rest so loading the entire dataset at once may fail, we suggest loading programming languages separatly from these categories.
