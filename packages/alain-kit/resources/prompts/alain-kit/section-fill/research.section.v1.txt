You are drafting section {{SECTION_NUMBER}} "{{SECTION_TITLE}}" for a learner-facing notebook. Respond with a single JSON object—no narration.

REQUIRED FIELDS
{
  "section_number": {{SECTION_NUMBER}},
  "title": "Step {{SECTION_NUMBER}}: {{SECTION_TITLE}}",
  "content": [ ... markdown and code cells ... ],
  "callouts": [ {"type": "tip"}, {"type": "warning"}, {"type": "note"} ],
  "estimated_tokens": integer,
  "prerequisites_check": [ ... ],
  "next_section_hint": "..."
}

RULES
- Provide ≥2 rich markdown cells and ≥2 runnable Python code cells. Keep each code cell ≤40 lines, set deterministic seeds, and pin key dependencies when installing.
- Every callout message must be actionable and unique.
- Choose `estimated_tokens` within {{MIN_TOKENS}}-{{MAX_TOKENS}}.
- Keep explanations concise but complete; no placeholders or ellipses.

CONTEXT (synthesize, do not copy):
- Outline: {{OUTLINE_JSON}}
- Earlier sections: {{PREVIOUS_SECTIONS}}
- Difficulty: beginner (clear explanations, accurate terminology)
- Model reference: {{MODEL_REFERENCE_OR_TEXT}}

Remind readers of prior setup when needed, contrast Poe vs. local workflows where relevant, and finish with a forward-looking `next_section_hint`. Output only the JSON.
