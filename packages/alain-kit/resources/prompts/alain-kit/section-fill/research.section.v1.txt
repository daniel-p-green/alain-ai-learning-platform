You are filling section {{SECTION_NUMBER}} titled "{{SECTION_TITLE}}" in a production-ready educational notebook.

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS
• Return a single valid JSON object. Do not add "Thinking...", explanations, or code fences.
• Start with {"section_number": {{SECTION_NUMBER}}} and close the JSON properly.
• Populate every field with polished beginner-friendly content. Never leave template text, placeholders, ellipses, or instructions in the output.
• Provide at least two markdown cells (multi-paragraph) and two runnable Python code cells (≤40 lines each) with comments, deterministic seeds, and explicit dependency versions. Add extra cells when they improve clarity.
• Include at least one tip, one warning, and one note inside `callouts`, each with actionable guidance.
• Keep the total content between {{MIN_TOKENS}} and {{MAX_TOKENS}} tokens and choose an integer for `estimated_tokens` within that range.

REQUIRED JSON SCHEMA (replace the guidance with your generated text/code):
{
  "section_number": {{SECTION_NUMBER}},
  "title": "Step {{SECTION_NUMBER}}: {{SECTION_TITLE}}",
  "content": [
    {
      "cell_type": "markdown",
      "source": "...multi-paragraph explanation with analogies, precise definitions, step-by-step rationale, and no truncated or placeholder language..."
    },
    {
      "cell_type": "code",
      "source": "...fully executable Python example demonstrating the concept with comments, deterministic seeds, and explicit dependency versions. Do not include TODOs, ellipses, or truncated snippets..."
    }
  ],
  "callouts": [
    { "type": "tip", "message": "...actionable best practice..." },
    { "type": "warning", "message": "...risk or pitfall to avoid..." },
    { "type": "note", "message": "...supplementary insight or reference..." }
  ],
  "estimated_tokens": {{DEFAULT_TOKENS}},
  "prerequisites_check": ["...checks confirming readers have prerequisites from earlier steps..."],
  "next_section_hint": "...one-sentence preview of the next step..."
}

CONTEXT TO USE (synthesize; do not copy verbatim):
• Outline JSON: {{OUTLINE_JSON}}
• Previous sections already generated: {{PREVIOUS_SECTIONS}}
• Target difficulty: beginner audience that still needs precise technical accuracy.
• Target model: {{MODEL_REFERENCE_OR_TEXT}}

ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES
• Define key terms before using them and explain trade-offs between Poe API and local workflows where relevant.
• Reference earlier setup decisions when appropriate and maintain reproducibility (seeds, version pins, environment variables).
• Ensure markdown remains instructional and the code runs as-is without hidden dependencies.
• Close with a `next_section_hint` that naturally bridges to the following section.

Return only the JSON object described above. If you need to reason, do so silently and emit only the final JSON.
