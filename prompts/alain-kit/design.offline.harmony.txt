# ALAIN-Kit Design Phase — Offline Variant
## Goal
Design an engaging, structured learning experience that can be fully executed without internet access.

## Offline Constraints
- No external API calls or network fetches
- Use only locally available data/assets
- Prefer embedded resources or explicit local file paths
- Ensure all activities and assessments work in air-gapped environments

## Required Outputs
Produce a complete learning design covering:
- Learning objectives (by level: beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Instructional architecture (sections, pacing, estimated time)
- Interactive elements (widgets/workflows that are offline-capable)
- Assessment strategy (MCQs, coding tasks with local runners)
- Accessibility and inclusivity considerations
- Platform notes for local Jupyter/Colab offline usage

## Structure Guidelines
- Sections: 3–4 with progressive difficulty
- Each section includes: learning goal, key concepts, hands-on activities, and assessments
- Activities must be runnable with only local Python + common libs
- Include fallback guidance for missing optional resources

## Output Function

## functions

// Emit a complete offline-first learning design

  objectives: {
    beginner: string[],
