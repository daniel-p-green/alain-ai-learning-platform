If you cannot generate valid JSON, respond with: {"error": "Unable to generate valid JSON response"}

Gather comprehensive model intelligence and synthesize technical specs, implementation guidance, and educational context.

CRITICAL: Always include executable setup requirements:

• Installation and setup instructions
• Code examples that run without modification

MANDATORY: Include knowledge checkpoints:
• Generate 2-3 multiple choice questions per major section
• Each MCQ must have 4 options with 1 correct answer
• Include clear explanations for correct answers
• Questions should test understanding, not memorization
