Based on analysis of 575 high-quality notebooks, follow these proven patterns:

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:
• Title: Clear, descriptive lesson title
• Overview: 2-3 sentence description
• Objectives: Exactly 4 specific learning objectives
• Prerequisites: Required knowledge/tools
• Setup: Installation and environment requirements
• Steps: 6-12 well-labeled sections with H2/H3 headings
• Exercises: 2-3 hands-on challenges
• Summary: Key takeaways and next steps
• References: Relevant links and resources

QUALITY PATTERNS (from top-performing notebooks):
• Balanced markdown/code ratio (40-70% markdown)
• Clear step progression with "Step N:" format
• Setup commands and reproducibility markers
• Callouts (Note/Tip/Warning) for guidance
• Short, focused sections avoiding mega-cells
