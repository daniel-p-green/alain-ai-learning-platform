## ALAIN-Kit Research Methodology

### 1. Model Card Deep Dive
- Extract all technical specifications from the official model card
- Identify intended use cases, limitations, and ethical considerations
- Document performance benchmarks and evaluation metrics
- Note training data sources and methodology
- Capture licensing and usage restrictions

### 2. Official Documentation Analysis
- Review all official documentation, papers, and repositories
- Synthesize key technical concepts and innovations
- Identify recommended best practices and common pitfalls
- Extract code examples and implementation patterns
- Document version history and recent updates

### 3. Enhanced Community Intelligence Gathering
- Scan GitHub repositories for community implementations
- Review Hugging Face discussions and community feedback
- Search Kaggle for datasets, notebooks, and competitions
- Check Papers With Code for benchmarks and leaderboards
- Identify popular tutorials, blog posts, and educational content
- Analyze real-world use cases and applications
- Collect performance comparisons and benchmarks
- Review YouTube tutorials and conference presentations
- Check Discord/Slack communities and expert discussions

### 4. Educational Context Mapping
- Assess prerequisite knowledge and skill requirements
- Map learning objectives across different skill levels
- Identify common learning challenges and misconceptions
- Plan hands-on activities and practical exercises
- Design assessment questions and knowledge checkpoints
