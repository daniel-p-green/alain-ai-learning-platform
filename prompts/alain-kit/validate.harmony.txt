    results = {
        'code_execution': test_all_code_cells(),
        'widget_functionality': test_interactive_elements(),
        'performance_metrics': measure_execution_performance(),
        'dependency_resolution': validate_environment_setup(),
        'export_capabilities': test_export_functionality()
    }
    return results
```

### Phase 2: Manual Testing Procedures
- Complete end-to-end notebook execution from start to finish
- Test all interactive elements with various input combinations
