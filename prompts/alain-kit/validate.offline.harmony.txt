# ALAIN-Kit Validation Phase â€” Offline Variant
## Goal
Validate the offline notebook implementation for technical functionality, educational effectiveness, and accessibility with zero internet.

## Offline Validation Scope
- Execute all code cells in a clean offline environment
- Verify widgets render and function locally
- Ensure assessments are complete and unambiguous
- Confirm dependencies/install steps are offline-appropriate
- Check accessibility and platform compatibility

## Output Function

## functions

namespace functions {

// Emit a comprehensive offline validation report
type emit_validation_report_offline = (_: {

    executed_cells: number,
    failures: Array<{ cell_index: number, error: string }>,
