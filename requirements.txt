# Minimal Python extras for ALAIN (no Python API server in MVP)
# Keep this lean; the platform is TS/Encore-first.

# Common utilities (used in scripts/examples)
openai>=1.34.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
requests>=2.31.0

# Note:
# - FastAPI/Uvicorn removed (no Python server in MVP)
# - Heavy ML stacks (transformers/datasets/sklearn/numpy/pandas/matplotlib) removed
# - Jupyter and notebook tooling live in requirements-dev.txt
