- **gpt-oss-120b:** 228ms processing, 229ms total
- **Performance Delta:** 120B model 29% faster than 20B model

### Resource Utilization
- Hugging Face API calls: 2 (both failed - models don't exist)
- arXiv API calls: 2 (no results)
- GitHub API calls: 2 (no results)
- Synthesis algorithm: 100% success rate

## Recommendations

### For Real Model Testing
1. **Use Actual Models:** Test with real Hugging Face models (e.g., `microsoft/DialoGPT-medium`)
2. **Broader Search Terms:** Expand arXiv search beyond exact model names
3. **Alternative Sources:** Add model documentation from official websites

### For Synthetic Model Handling
1. **Fallback Content:** Enhanced research system successfully provided educational value even without external sources
2. **Topic Intelligence:** System correctly leveraged topic keywords to generate relevant content
3. **Quality Scoring:** Consider adjusting scoring algorithm to weight educational value higher when sources are unavailable
