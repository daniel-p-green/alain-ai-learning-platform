      ],
      "correct_index": 0,
      "explanation": "Running a cell via the Run button or Shift+Enter executes the cell. Renaming or opening tabs does not execute code; markdown needs to be run to render."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a slider widget does nothing, what is the most likely first fix?",
      "options": [
        "Install a new web browser",
        "Ensure ipywidgets>=8.0.0 is installed and the kernel restarted",
        "Delete the notebook and start over",
        "Turn off Wi‑Fi"
      ],
      "correct_index": 1,
      "explanation": "Interactive widgets require ipywidgets. Installing/confirming ipywidgets>=8.0.0 and restarting the kernel usually resolves it. Deleting files or changing network is unnecessary."

      "question": "Why does cell order matter in notebooks?",
      "options": [
        "It doesn’t matter at all",
        "Later cells can change earlier cells automatically",
        "Variables are created when cells run, so skipping earlier cells can cause errors",
        "Order only matters for markdown cells"
      ],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Notebooks keep a live memory. If a cell that defines a variable hasn’t run, later cells that use it will fail. Markdown has no variables; order matters mainly for code dependency."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which is the safest beginner practice when trying new code?",
      "options": [
        "Run every cell at once without reading",

        "Use small, visible steps and re-run cells, saving often",
        "Change random settings to see what happens"
      ],
      "correct_index": 3,
      "explanation": "Safety and fairness mean being careful, reproducible, and respectful of limits. However, among the options, the best practice is to use small steps, re-run, and save often to avoid confusion and unintended effects."
