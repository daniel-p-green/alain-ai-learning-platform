  "title": "Quick Smoke Outline: A 10-Minute Check to See If Things Work",
  "overview": "This lesson teaches you how to run a quick, friendly \"smoke test\"—a fast check to see if your tools and a tiny piece of a project work at all. You’ll set up a simple environment, run a small test, read the signals (green = good, red = needs help), and log what you find so you can fix issues calmly.",

    "Explain what a smoke test is and why it’s useful for quick checks",
