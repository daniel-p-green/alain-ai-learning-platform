Share it with another editor for the final review\u2014fresh eyes often spot tone or clarity issues the author misses.\n\n**Next ideas:**\n1. Add server-side rate limiting per model before exposing publicly.\n2. Build a compare view that renders latency deltas across models.\n3. Pipe telemetry into a hosted dashboard (e.g., Vercel Analytics or PostHog)."
